Atmospheric conditions induced by suspended particles, such as fog and haze,
severely alter the scene appearance. Restoring the true scene appearance from a single observation made
in such bad weather conditions remains a challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity that arises
in the image formation process. In this paper, we introduce
a novel Bayesian probabilistic method that jointly estimates
the scene albedo and depth from a single foggy image by
fully leveraging their latent statistical structures.
